.SH NAME
ftphosts \- ftpd individual user host access file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The ftphosts file is used to allow or deny access to certain
accounts from various hosts.
.SH ACCESS CAPABILITIES
.TP 0.5i
.B allow <username> <addrglob> [<addrglob> ...]
Only allow host(s) matching <addrglob> to log in as <username>.
.TP 0.5i
.B deny <username> <addrglob> [<addrglob> ...]
Always deny host(s) matching <addrglob> to log in as <username>.
.PP
A username of
.B anonymous
or
.B ftp
specifies the anonymous user.
.PP
The <addrglob> may be also be specified as address/cidr or address:netmask.  For example:
10.0.0.0/8 or 10.0.0.0:255.0.0.0

NOTE VERY CAREFULLY:

The last rule which matches is the default rule.  So, to allow a user to login
from anywhere _except_ the listed hosts, you need both allow and deny rules.
The following example denies the user hacked from logging in from the host
10.1.2.3, but allows login from all other hosts.

deny hacked 10.1.2.3
allow hacked *
