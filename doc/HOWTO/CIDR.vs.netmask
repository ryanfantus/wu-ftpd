Edited excerpt from a private conversation.  For those who don't know what
CIDR is, this should help:

For IPv4 there are only 32 acceptable netmask / CIDR values (not 33):

255.255.255.255  /32               1

Note the absence of 255.255.255.254 (CIDR /31).  This is not acceptable
since it defines a network with a network address and a broadcast address,
but no host addresses available.  While such a network might be usable for
broadcast-only applications, it's probably not usable in most real-world
situations.  For FTP, where we need a _host_ address, no host could
possibly exist so the netmask / CIDR value makes no sense.

Using netmasks, nonsense such as 255.128.0.1 is possible and even works as
one would expect (with a lot of careful thought) on most Unix systems
(provided you can set it; many command-level tools prevent it), but it
makes for a VERY odd network architecture.
