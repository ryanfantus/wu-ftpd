These are **SAMPLES**

If you use them unchanged, it's your own !@#$ed fault if things go wrong.

PAM		Sample PAM config.  Put in /etc/pam.d/ftp

README		This file

ftpaccess	Sample ftpaccess.  Put in /etc/ftpaccess

ftpaccess.heavy	Sample ftpaccess.  Put in /etc/ftpaccess AFTER EDITING

ftpconversions	Sample conversions.  Put in /etc/ftpconversions.  Works for
		most sites.

ftpconversions.solaris
		Sample conversions, for Solaris.

ftpgroups	Sample private groups file.  You probably don't need this.  Put
		in /etc/ftpgroups.

		restrictions.  Put in /etc/ftphosts.

		/etc/shells.

ftpservers	Sample new-style virtual hosts.  Put in /etc/ftpservers ONLY if

ftpusers	WARNING: NEGATIVE LOGIC HERE!
		**SAMPLE** listing of users NOT allowed to use FTP.

xinetd		Sample xinet configuration.  Add this to /etc/xinetd.conf.
		Note the options.  Also not the XXX...XXX junk is to reserver
		enough space for setproctitle to play with on Linux .. systems
		which don't overwrite argv probably won't need it.

ftpsd.conf	Sample TLS (SSL) configuration file - point to this with the
		-z config=/etc/ftpsd.conf parameter on the command line - if
		you compiled TLS support in (./configure --enable-tls)
