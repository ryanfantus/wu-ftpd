# First - define the debugging info (if it was compiled in)

# Where is the debug file to be written

# Do we want to turn debugging on

# Are we actually going to allow TLS ?
#########################################################################
#
# If we don't want to allow TLS on this sever then set this flag
#notls
#########################################################################
# Now define our SSL info

#
# Where is the CA cert file (sent to clients for client auth)
CAfile=/usr/local/ftp_tls/x.509/ca/ca_cert.pem

# Where is the CA path (CAs to check clients certs against)

# Where is the RSA cert file

# What is the PEM decryption password
#password=
#no default (keyfile is not encryptd)

# Where is the CRL dir

# How do we want to drive the authentication - values are:
# server; client_can and client_must

authmode=client_can
#
# What do we want to do about any PASS command once we have a 
#  successfully authenticated session?
#
# certok (default):-
#  successful USER is replied to by 232
#  PASS commands give "5xx"
#
# needpass:-
#  successful USER is replied to by 331
#  PASS commands are processed as if the SSL authentication never took place
#
certpass=certok
#
# flags (all off by default)
#
# Don't check the CA of the client
# if you are getting really wierd errors - try setting this flag on
#certsok
#
# Allow the old AUTH SSL command
#allow_auth_ssl
#
# Behave like wu-ftpd ssl used to (incorrectly !)
#bad_auth_ssl_reply
#
# Only allow USER on a secure connection
# NOTE: this affects _all_ supported security mechanisms.  If this flag
#       is set (unless 'notls' is set) then the server will not allow
#       unprotected USER commands.  (they may be protected by any 
#       other security mechanism (e.g. GSS) if compiled and configured)
#       - all other parms in this file are only used if TLS is selected
#         by the user with an appropriate AUTH command.
#       - this parameter has two synonyms 'protect_user' and 'tlsonly'
#         the latter for compatibility, the former for clarity.
#protect_user
#
# Only allow data xfer on secure ports
#tlsdata
#
# Only allow certificates to be used for authentication
#clientcert
#
# Allow the user to switch the control connection back to plaintext
#  >>> This is potentially very dangerous - ensure you know 
#  >>>  exactly _why_ you want to set this value.
#allowccc
#
# The RSA private key ('key') and certificate ('cert') are 
# in ASN.1 (DER) format and not the default PEM format.
#rsader
#
# Normally we only log the first protected data connection 
#  to preserve space in the syslog.  If you want - all 
#  protected data connections can be logged with this option.
# N.B. unprotected data connection logging is unaffected by this
#logalldata
