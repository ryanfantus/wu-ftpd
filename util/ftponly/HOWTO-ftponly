                    Restricting Interactive Shell Access

     In order to restrict WU-FTPD guest accounts to ftp only, it is
     necessary to have a shell specified in the /etc/passwd that does
     not allow the user to simply telnet to the system and login with
     the guest account's password.

     On some systems, if the specified shell does not exist it will
     simply log you out. On those systems it is possible to simply put
     an invalid name in the passwd file entry and then also include
     that same name in the /etc/shells file. There are some security
     dangers here. If the directory you have your bogus shell listed in
     is writable by another group, it might be possible for a user to
     insert a shell there in the proper place thus opening a door to
     your system. It is recommended that this approach not be taken
     even though it may be doable.

     Another method is to link in a non-executable file so that when
     the specified shell is executed, it fails and logs the user out.
     To make sure this is a usable method you must select a file that
     is not going to ever have execute permissions.

     One of the major problems with both of the above methods is that
     they do not teach or warn the user that what they are doing is not
     acceptable.

     My recommended method is to create a small shell script or program
     that does nothing except alert the user that they do not have
     permission to access the system interactively. The example below
     is a simple one. If you are the more paranoid type, you could add
     logging or email alerts to it so you know what users are trying to
     get interactive access to your systems.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     # ftponly shell
     #
     trap "/bin/echo Sorry; exit 0" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 15
     #
     IFS=""
     Admin=access@host.some.domain
     System=`/usr/ucb/hostname`@`/usr/bin/domainname`
     #
     /bin/echo
     /bin/echo "************************************************************"
     /bin/echo "    You are NOT allowed interactive access to $System."
     /bin/echo
     /bin/echo "     User accounts are restricted to ftp and web access."
     /bin/echo
     /bin/echo "  Direct questions concerning this policy to $Admin."
     /bin/echo "************************************************************"
     /bin/echo
     #
     # C'ya
     #
     exit 0

     Save the above as ftponly in /bin or /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
     and set its mode to 755. Make sure you put the path to it in the
     guest account shell field you want to restrict. Then put it in
     /etc/shells (or where ever your shells file is located.) Finally,
     test it. Make sure that you cannot break out of it by sending it
     various interrupts.
