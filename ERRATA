Known problems (2.8.0)
======================
These are problems which are known and will be corrected in future versions.



getcwd()
--------
A number of systems have no getcwd() function or their implementation of
the function is broken in some way.  A portable version of the getcwd()
function has been included in the support directory.  NeXTstep version 3
(nx3) and SunOS 4.1 (s41) are configured to use this portable version of
getcwd().  If your system is one of the following systems, and you get this
portable version to work, please report any change needed so we may include
them in a future release.  Remember, systems without a working getcwd()
have an identified security problem.

Systems needing getcwd():

  BSD 4.4       (bsd)
  Unix 3.x      (dec)
  DG/UX         (dgx)
  Dynix         (dyn)
  generic       (gen)
  NeXTstep 2.x  (nx2)
  OSF/1         (osf)
  Sony NewsOS   (sny)
